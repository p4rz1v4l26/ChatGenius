# ChatGPT Youtube Bot

Welcome to the ChatGPT Youtube Bot setup guide! This Node.js Chat Bot integrates seamlessly with ChatGPT, providing prompt responses and engaging conversations. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set up and customize your own version of the bot.

## 1. Fork this on Github

Start by logging into your Github account and forking this repository. Don't forget to give it a star too!

---

## 2. Fill out your context file

Open the file named `file_context.txt` and fill it with background information for ChatGPT. This information enhances the bot's responses. Feel free to provide any details you think would be helpful for training your bot.

---

## 3. Create an OpenAI account

Visit [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com) and create an account. Initially, you'll have a free usage limit, but later on, you may need to pay for server usage. You can set a spending limit in your account settings to manage costs.

---

## 4. Get your OpenAI Secure Key

In your OpenAI account, navigate to the API keys section and generate a new secret key. Keep this key safe, as it will be used to authorize your bot with OpenAI. Treat it like the key to your wallet.

---

## 5. Deploy this repo on Render or any service provider

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)
Click the button to deploy this repository on Render or choose any other service provider you prefer. Log in with your Github account and select your repository for deployment.

---

## 6. Set your environment variables

After deployment, set up three environment variables in your deployment settings:

### GPT_MODE

Choose between two values:

- **"CHAT"**: Chat mode with history. It's cheaper than prompt mode but faster. Uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
- **"PROMPT"**: Prompt mode with no history. Uses the `text-davinci-003` model.

### HISTORY_LENGTH

This variable only works when GPT_MODE is set to "CHAT". Enter a number to define how many bot-user conversations will be saved and sent along with the most recent user message. This allows ChatGPT to remember context and engage in conversations.

### OPENAI_API_KEY

Paste your OpenAI Secure Key here.

## 7. Get your API Link from Render

Copy the API link provided by Render after deployment. You can find it in the top-left corner below the title of your deployed repository.

---

## 8. Add your API Command to your Chatbot

Now, let's integrate your Chat Command:

### Nightbot

Go to your Nightbot commands page and add a new command. Enter the following message:

```bash
$(urlfetch https://your-Render-url.app/gpt/"$(user):$(querystring)")
```

Replace "your-Render-url.app" with the API link you copied earlier.
